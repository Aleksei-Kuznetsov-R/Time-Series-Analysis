# Time-Series-Analysis

_Time Series Analysis_ is a set of methods and techniques used to analyze data collected in consecutive time intervals. The purpose of time series analysis is to identify patterns and trends over time, predict future values, and understand the structure of data. 

The main aspects of time series analysis:
* **Trend:** the long-term direction of change in the data (increase or decrease).
* **Seasonality:** regular fluctuations that recur at regular intervals (e.g. monthly or annual fluctuations).
* **Cyclicality:** fluctuations due to economic or other factors that occur over longer time intervals.
* **Noise:** random and unpredictable fluctuations that cannot be explained.

Methods of analysis:
**Decomposition:** dividing a time series into trend, seasonality, and noise for deeper analysis.
**Moving Average:** Smoothing data to identify major trends.
**Autocorrelation:** analyze the relationship between current time series values and past values.

Forecasting models:

**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** one of the most popular models for time series forecasting, including autoregression, integration and moving average.
**SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** an extension of the ARIMA model that takes into account seasonal components.
**Exponential Smoothing:** A method that uses exponential functions to smooth and predict data.
